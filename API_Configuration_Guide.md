# üîß API Configuration & Fallback System Guide

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ **What's Working (Without API Keys)**
The StockViz system is designed to work gracefully even without external API keys:

1. **Technical Analysis** - ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
   - Uses Yahoo Finance data (no API key needed)
   - Calculates 15+ technical indicators

   - **Score Range:** Typically 30-80 based on technical patterns

2. **Basic Stock Data** - ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What's Using Fallbacks (Missing API Keys)**

1. **Fundamental Analysis** - üîÑ **FALLBACK MODE**
   - **Missing:** `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`
   - **Fallback:** Returns score of 50 (neutral)
   - **Note:** "Fallback fundamentals for [SYMBOL]: Missing ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY"

2. **Sentiment Analysis** - üîÑ **FALLBACK MODE**
   - **Missing:** External sentiment API keys
   - **Fallback:** Returns score of 50 (neutral)
   - **Note:** "No external sentiment source configured or fetch failed for [SYMBOL]"

3. **Enhanced AI (Optional)** - üîÑ **FALLBACK MODE**
   - **Missing:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Fallback:** Uses built-in analysis templates
   - **Still Works:** Educational explanations and technical guidance
