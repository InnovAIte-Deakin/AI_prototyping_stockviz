## Next Immediate Steps:

1. **Replace Current Components**
   - Update Indicators.tsx page to use EnhancedIndicatorsPanel
   - Update Weights.tsx page to use EnhancedWeightsPanel
   - Test functionality preservation

2. **Create Enhanced Analysis Display**
   - Build rich visualization components for analysis results
   - Add proper loading and error states
   - Implement progressive disclosure patterns

3. **Upgrade Navigation Experience**
